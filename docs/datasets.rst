General Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The datasets can have AsIs in their name. This means that the dataset is the exact match of what is available online, and the user should be careful when using it.
The AsIs datasets have not gone through any cleaning or processing.

Detailed description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **CSD MOF Collection Original:**
    - Location: /disk2/CSD_MOF_Collection_AsIs
    - Count: 14,077
    - File Type: .cif
    - Relevant link: `CSD <https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/free-products/csd-mof-collection/>`_
    - Availablity: Free
    
    The CSD MOF collection contains just over 14,000 3D MOF crystal structures available to use for free in academic research.
    The information about curation strategy has not been found yet (add if you know). They mention that the 3D MOF structures with no disorder in the main framework are around 27,000 in the CSD,
    and after curation they have 14,000 structures that are computation ready and have significant void space.
    
    **Naming:** The file names have the CCDC code + "_P1" + either "_H" or "_charged" or "_charged_H" + ".cif" as the extension.
    Example file names: "kivfay_P1_H.cif", "kivlou_P1_charged.cif", "kinrik_P1_charged_H.cif"
